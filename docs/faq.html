    <p class="subtitle">
      Short answers to predictable objections. This project is not a vibe. It is an argument.
    </p>

  <main>
    <section>
      <h2>Is this anti-federalism?</h2>
      <p>
        No. Federalism is about allocation of authority between governments. Immunity is about whether a government can
        be held accountable when it violates federal law.
      </p>
      <p>
        A system can respect state autonomy and still insist that states comply with the Constitution and federal
        statutes.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Does repeal mean states will be sued into bankruptcy?</h2>
      <p>
        Not as a legal necessity. The proposed amendment expressly preserves congressional authority to regulate
        remedies, including limits on damages and procedural requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
        The objective is not maximal liability. The objective is that illegality is not categorically insulated from
        judicial review.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Is this just a way to get around Ex parte Young?</h2>
      <p>
        It is a way to stop pretending that Ex parte Young is a coherent long-term solution.
      </p>
      <p>
        Young is a workaround: it permits prospective relief against state officials by treating the suit as not truly
        against the State, even when everyone understands that it is. That fiction invites arbitrary line-drawing and
        lets courts avoid merits decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Repeal would make accountability direct, rather than dependent on metaphysical pleading rituals.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Are you saying states should have no immunity at all?</h2>
      <p>
        The claim here is narrower: state sovereign immunity should not operate as a jurisdictional bar when federal law
        supplies a right and a remedy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Legislatures can and will continue to shape the scope of liability and the available remedies. The amendment is
        directed at categorical immunity doctrines that override enacted federal law and foreclose adjudication.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What about frivolous lawsuits?</h2>
      <p>
        Federal courts already have tools for this: pleading standards, sanctions, fee-shifting statutes where
        applicable, and summary judgment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Immunity is a blunt instrument. It does not target frivolity. It targets enforceability, including in
        meritorious cases.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Does this expand judicial power?</h2>
      <p>
        It restores the judicial role. Courts exist to decide the legality of government action when a proper claim is
        presented.
      </p>
      <p>
        The modern immunity regime often prevents courts from reaching the legality question at all, even where the
        alleged violation is ongoing.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Why not rely on Congress to abrogate immunity in specific statutes?</h2>
      <p>
        That approach is unstable because it depends on judicial permission slips. The Supreme Court has repeatedly
        narrowed Congress’s ability to authorize suits against states, and it has treated sovereign immunity as an
        overriding constitutional principle rather than a narrow textual constraint.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the problem is structural, the solution must be structural.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What about suits against the United States?</h2>
      <p>
        The proposed text addresses sovereign immunity for both the United States and the States in federal question
        cases, while preserving congressional power to regulate remedies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Waivers and remedy limits can remain. The point is that sovereignty should not be a categorical jurisdictional
        veto over enforcement of federal law.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Is this realistic?</h2>
      <p>
        Constitutional amendments are rarely “realistic” until they become legible. The immediate purpose of this
        project is to make the argument legible, stable, and easy to reuse.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you think the doctrine is indefensible, saying so clearly is not unrealistic. It is step one.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Where is the source?</h2>
      <p>
        The intent is to host the site via GitHub Pages with a public repository. If you are reading this on the
        deployed site, the footer should link to the source.
